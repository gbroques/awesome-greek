# The Accent (Ο Τόνος)

The accent is a marking on top of vowels denoting which syllable in a word is stressed during pronunciation.

1. on top of vowels (ά, έ, ί, ή, ύ, ό, ώ)
2. second vowel of vowel combintations (αί, εί, οί, ού, αύ, ...)
3. one of the last three syllables of a word (e.g. κατηγορώ)
4. not on one-syllable words (ναι, μη, να, τον)
    * **Exceptions:** ή, πού
5. not on all-capital words (e.g. ΑΠΑΓΟΡΕΓΕΤΑΙ)
6. when the first vowel is capital (and stressed) it gets an accent (e.g. Άννα)

## Why Do Some Words Get Two Accent Marks?

Monosyllabic words are naturally stressed when pronounced, but not accented.

**Enclisis** - before some specific monosyllabic words, other monosyllabic words and some poly syllabic words develop get a second accent mark. We pronounce the words closely together.

**Enclitics** - words that cause *enclisis*.
    * Weak forms of personal and possesive pronouns
    * με, μου, σε, σου, τον, του, τη(ν), της, το, μας, σας, τους, τις, τες, τα


1. Proparoxytone noun or adjective followed my monosyllabic possesive pronoun (e.g. μου (my), σου (yours), του (his)).
    * Example: το παράθυρό μου (my window)

[Proparoxytone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proparoxytone) - a word with stress on the [antepenultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_(linguistics)) (third from last) syllable.
